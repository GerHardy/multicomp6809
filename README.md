I always wanted a 6809 machine. I still have the A4 notebook where I sketched out design ideas. However, I never simultaneously had the time and money to build one from scratch (even though I have accumulated all of the parts in my junk box over the years).

When I saw this http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html I realised I could satisfy my yearning without too much soldering.

I decided that I would run Brad Rodriguez's Camelforth on it. Before I did that I resussitated a 6809 emulator and added crude support first for Brad's "scroungmaster" machine and then for the 6809 multicomp machine. That emulator is exec09.

This repository is a venue for sharing the hardware and software that I have used on my multicomp.
